# Extended-Source-Diffraction

MATLAB code to simulate the diffraction of a wave through an arbitrary aperture.

To use, set the variables in diffraction_main.m for the size of the source and the properties of it. Then the aperture is set in aperture_funct.m, currently it is set up for a frensel zone plate but this can be altered for any aperture desired.
